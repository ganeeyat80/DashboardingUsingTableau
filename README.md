#### Employee Attrition Analysis & Dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive summary analysis of employee data, highlighting key insights to support decision-making around workforce attrition. 

## Project Overview

* Departments
* Gender
* Age groups
* Job satisfaction levels
* Education background

The goal is to support HR and management teams in making **data-driven decisions** that improve employee retention and enhance workforce stability.

* High-risk departments (e.g., Sales, R\&D) with higher attrition rates
* Age groups and job roles most affected by turnover
* The relationship between **job satisfaction levels** and attrition
* Education backgrounds (Life Sciences, Medical, Technical) linked with higher exits
